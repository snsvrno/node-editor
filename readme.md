this is a node based path editor in love2D.

this is primarly made for my own need for a tool that will allow me to make a network of switches and then evaluate them to create a "random" story.

an example would be you want to create a setting for a story, or determine what some starting points. you can create some nodes, connect them and run it and it will choose one option in each node, follow the path and then create a unique story, setting, loadout, etc ..

currently in early alpha, probably will not work as expected.
